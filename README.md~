# Visualization Library for OpenCV

This library implements a simple GUI in OpenCV with button, text-, and image-stream functionality.

## Motivation

The visualization library is meant for use in projects where OpenCV is used as is and no third-party GUI packages are installed. It should be especially helpful when creating dynamic interfaces in combination with ROS.

## Installation

The software is self-contained and uses no additional dependencies except OpenCV 2.4.8 

## How to use

The library can be included into any project. A simple window with a button, some text and an image stream could be done as below:
```c++
auto gui = std::make_shared<visualization::GraphicalUserInterface>(10, 1000, 2000); 
//args are (padding, height, width of window)

// Add button
std::function<void(void)> buttonOnCallback = std::bind(foo,foo_args_1, foo_args_2);
std::function<void(void)> buttonOffCallback = std::bind(foo_,foo__args_1, foo__args_2)
gui->addCanvasElement(visualization::BUTTON, cv::Point(topleft.x,topleft.y), width, height, "BUTTON_NAME", buttonOnCallback, buttonOffCallback);

//Add text
gui->addCanvasElement(visualization::TEXT_STREAM, cv::Point(topleft.x,topleft.y), 0, 0, "DEFAULT_TEXT");

// Update text and color anytime using the function below
gui->text_streams_[0]->setText("Some string", cv::Point3f(0,0,0));

// Add image stream
gui->addCanvasElement(visualization::IMAGE_VIEW, cv::Point(topleft.x,topleft.y),image_width,image_height,"Image_Title");

// Register the underlying image via
gui->image_views_[0]->setImageSource(&ANY_IMAGE_ADDRESS);

// Re-render the gui with
gui->render();

// Always make sure that the render function is placed inside a loop 

```
